# swifty-companion

The aim of this app was to code an app in SwiftUI by using the 42 API to get information on a user.

---- 

My application displays the following information on a given user :
* His/her login
* His/her 42 level
* His/her location inside the school
* His/her coalition
* His/her projects done at 42
* His/her achievements at 42
* His/her skills

An autocomplete is available for all the users at the 42 campus in Paris. You need to enter at least 3 letters and tap search.

I created some Figma view before coding that you can find [here](https://github.com/llescure/swifty-companion/tree/main/swifty-companion/swifty-companion/Preview%20Content/Preview%20Assets.xcassets/Figma)

:warning::warning: **You will need an UID and a secret generated by the 42 API to make the app work** :warning::warning:
