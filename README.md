# swifty-companion

The aim of this app was to code an app in SwiftUI by using the 42 API to get information on a user.

---- 

My application displays the following information on a given user :
* His/her login
* His/her 42 level
* His/her location inside the school
* His/her coalition
* His/her projects done at 42
* His/her achievements at 42
* His/her skills

An autocomplete is available for all the users at the 42 campus in Paris.

Here is a short video of the app in action:
